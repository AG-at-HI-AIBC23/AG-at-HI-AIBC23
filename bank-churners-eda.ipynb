A growing churn can mean a couple of things:\n","- The economic implication of a growing churn rate will result in lowering the customer lifetime value, witch may lead to lower revenue and profit margins. It may also lead to a lower market share due to loss of customers to compatitors. One other economic aspect related to churn is the term customer accuazision cost, with is the avrege cost for accuaring a new customer. The norm is that its more expensive to accuire a new customer then trying to keed an existing customer. \n","- If customers are leaving it may also indicate that some things are not working with the product or service.
