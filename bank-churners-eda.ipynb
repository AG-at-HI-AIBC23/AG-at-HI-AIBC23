The random forrest will be used to analyse the importance of each feature and the fie least important features will be removed before trining neural network. A datasampling technique using SMOTE was introduced in version three to reduce gape between two classes"

    "- The economic implication of a growing churn rate will result in lowering the customer lifetime value, witch may lead to lower revenue and profit margins. It may also lead to a lower market share due to loss of customers to compatitors. One other economic aspect related to churn is the term customer accuazision cost, with is the avrege cost for accuaring a new customer. The norm is that its more expensive to accuire a new customer then trying to keed an existing customer. \n",

    " To understand churn it would be benefitial to set some relevant metrics when mesuring it. One central metic to mesure is time, ie. how long has the client used the products/services? The relevant metrics for mesuring churn may vary depending on the industry and type of customer interaction that is important for the company. For most companies it may be revenue, conversion rates or some other similar metric, but for some, like facebook / instagram, it may be engagement and time spend on the platform. "
